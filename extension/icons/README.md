# Extension Icons

This directory should contain the following icon files for the extension:

- `icon16.png` - 16x16 pixels
- `icon48.png` - 48x48 pixels  
- `icon128.png` - 128x128 pixels

You can create these icons using any image editing tool. The icons should represent the SIFT fact-checking extension (e.g., a magnifying glass, checkmark, or shield icon).

For now, you can use placeholder icons or create simple icons using online tools like:
- https://www.favicon-generator.org/
- https://realfavicongenerator.net/

## Quick Icon Creation

1. Create a 128x128 icon with your design
2. Resize it to 48x48 and 16x16 versions
3. Save them as PNG files in this directory

The extension will work without icons, but Chrome will show a default placeholder icon.
